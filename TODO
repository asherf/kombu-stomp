* Compression support: when we sent a compressed message ActiveMQ seems to not
  being sending back the compression header, so Kombu doesn't know how to
  handle the message.
* Do we need a queue iterator sentinel?? So we can notify the queue is empty
  and probably set QoS to not able to consume.
* STOMP transaction support
* Right now we only support STOMP 1.0, it would be nice adding support for
  1.0 and/or 1.1.
* Support more connection options: right now we only consider credentials, host
  and port.
* Do not block on connect unconditionally (see kombu nowait kwarg)
* SSL support
